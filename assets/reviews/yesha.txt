When it comes to Filipino movies and makeup, Paolo Elito Macapagal Ballesteros IV, or what we always call Paolo Ballesteros, is well-known for his incredible makeup transformation skills and his huge impact on local entertainment. Paolo has become one of the most recognizable faces in the Philippines, not just because of her talent, but also because of how she confidently expresses herself through art, humor, and creativity. Starting from transforming into celebrities using only makeup, to acting in films that leave a mark on people, Paolo has shown time and time again how talented she is.

Paolo is an actor as well as a drag queen in the Philippines. She is also known as one of the long-time hosts of Eat Bulaga, where her charm and wit made her even more popular. Many people admire her not only for her beauty and skills, but also for her genuineness and the courage she shows in a society that can be harsh toward people like her. Mama Pao is truly a great actor, someone who can make you laugh, inspire you, and also break your heart in a single performance, she is really a one-of-a-kind human being.

It is widely known that Die Beautiful is one of her classic movies, where she plays the main character “Trisha Echevarria”. The movie is about her, Trisha, a trans woman who dreams of joining beauty pageants, something she has loved ever since she was a child. She was loved by a lot of people, but not by her own family. Her dad opposed the way she was, which resulted in her leaving their household. Of course, she did not regret anything, as there were plenty of people willing to accept her. Even after the miserable things that happened during her high school days, she didn’t stop being kind to others. Trisha continued to be kind and continued to be her true self. She also took care of her daughter, Shirley Mae. Even her daughter loved her for who she was. And even after her own death, she still wished to be beautiful, her last wish to her friend, Barb, was to change her makeup and gowns every day on her funeral so she could “die beautiful.”

There’s no denying that she did not deserve to go through all of those hardships, because Trisha is a human being, she’s normal, and there’s nothing wrong with her. But instead of receiving the love and support she needed, she got the opposite treatment from the very people she thought she could trust. Despite all the things that she faced, Trisha continued to see the good in the world and chose to stay to be herself. She held on to kindness when the world wasn’t kind to her, and she stayed true to herself even when society made her feel like she did not belong, especially to her own family.

Watching her story made me realize how our society has long struggled to accept people who express themselves differently or simply show who they really are. Instead of understanding, people often throw harsh words, outdated beliefs, or even Bible verses to justify their judgment. It creates this idea that being yourself is somehow a sin, when in reality, authenticity hurts no one. Up until now, in our society many still refuse to open their minds, and people like Trisha continue to face the same struggles. Her story reminds us how important acceptance, empathy, and respect truly are, because everyone deserves the freedom to exist without fear or shame. Being kind to people is free, and it won’t cost you anything in your life. In fact, it was supposed to be that way, for people to live freely, for people to enjoy their life to the fullest before they depart this life.

So, which came first in this world, the chicken or the egg? Watch the movie and you’ll find out. :D
