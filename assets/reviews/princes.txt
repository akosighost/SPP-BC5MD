I love this movie so much that I could watch it every week. It gives important lessons, and special credit goes to Paulo Ballesteros He's just a good actor but a good make up artist, who played Trisha Echevarria. His talent in copying celebrities’ faces made the movie more fun and enjoyable to watch. Heres the thoughts of me for watching this Why do we have to be a bad person? That question popped into my head while I was watching the movie. Before I share what I think about it, here is a quick story about what happened.

The movie follows Trisha Echevarria, a trans woman who dreams of becoming a beauty queen. The problem is her father does not accept her. He is homophobic and abusive, and he hurts her. Before she lived as Trisha, her name was Patrick. As the story goes, Trisha adopts a child named Adora because her mother died and no one wants to take care of her. Trisha feels pity for her, so she decides to adopt her. She even changes Adora’s name to Shirley Mae Echevarria because she thinks the name Adora sounds like rat poison. She cares for Shirley. She loves her. She sends her to school. Things start to get hard for Shirley when she enters school. Her classmates think Trisha is a gay parent and not her real mother. 

When Trisha is still in school, she meets a guy named Migs. He does something bad to her. He plays with her feelings. One day, Trisha and Barbs are walking in the hallway. Barbs sees Migs in the parking area and tells Trisha it is her chance to return the jersey he asked her to wash. Trisha goes to him right away. Migs invites her to eat outside with his friends. Two days later, after Trisha and Migs go out, Trisha does not show up to Barbs. Barbs worries about her. When she finally sees Trisha walking past them, she asks what happened. Trisha stays quiet until they reach the comfort room. Barbs feels something is wrong and asks her again. Trisha tells her the truth. She is not a virgin anymore because Migs and his best friend did things to her. At first she agreed. After the fourth guy, she felt powerless. She does not know if she should call it rape because she agreed at the start.

Trisha went to the hospital because of an anal injury. Her father came to see her and asked, “What happened?” Trisha, feeling scared, said it was just gastritis. The doctor came in and explained that her injury was caused by penetration and trauma. Her father looked confused. The doctor said it would be easier if Trisha explained what happened herself. That’s when her father realized she had been with a man. He got angry and slapped her, saying, “You’re gross!” He said other hurtful words too. Trisha stayed quiet, too scared to speak. Beth, Trisha’s sister, stopped him because they were in a public place. She told Trisha, “What you did was awful, but why did you do it?” Trisha stayed quiet, too scared to speak. As time goes by, Trisha wants to become a beauty queen. She joins a beauty contest to fulfill her dream, but her father is against it. He decides that Trisha is no longer his child and tells her not to use his surname or the name Patrick. Trisha decides to leave their home and change her name. She chooses to stay with Barbs and find a job to support herself. She also joins the beauty contest with Barbs. 

This time, Trisha meets a man named Jesse. At first, Jesse seems to love and respect her for who she is. Trisha thinks he genuinely cares for her and believes they could have a future together. She later learns that Jesse has a wife, but she is eager to have someone to love, so she continues to spend time with him.After about a month, Jesse stops talking to Trisha. He does not answer her calls or texts. When Trisha gets home, she sees Shirley with a girl in their house. She asks who the girl is. Shirley says she is Jesse’s wife and that Jesse wants to talk to Trisha. When they arrive at the hospital, Trisha is confused to see Jesse lying in bed, sleeping. Diana, Jesse’s wife, gives them time to talk when he wakes up. Trisha asks Jesse why he never told her he was sick with leukemia. Jesse tries to explain. He says his illness is like karma for what he did. Jesse confesses that he was one of the men involved when Trisha was raped by Migs and his friends. He says the guilt never left him, and he constantly thinks about what happened. That is why he followed Trisha. Trisha thinks Jesse’s care for her comes from guilt. But Jesse insists that he truly loves her, not just because of what happened in the past.

Here’s the final part of the story: Trisha joins a beauty pageant on a TV show. Shirley is older now and has a boyfriend and she's pregnant. Trisha and Shirley had a misunderstanding because Trisha wants Shirley to become a beauty queen, but Shirley does not want it. It is not her dream. Trisha wins the contest. She becomes Miss Gay, representing the Bahamas. During the celebration, all the other trans women, including Miss Iza, greet her. But while taking pictures, Trisha suddenly feels dizzy and loses consciousness. Barbs quickly takes her to the hospital to try to save her, but Trisha does not survive. She dies from an aneurysm. At the beauty contest, backstage, Trisha told Barbs that if she died, she wanted her first look at her burial to be like Angelina Jolie. When Trisha passed away, Barbs made sure to fulfill her wish. Every night of her wake, Trisha was dressed in different looks. The second look was Miss Iza Calsado, the one who had crowned her. The third look was Miley Cyrus, and the next one was a runaway bride. I think it's Julia Roberts, though the movie didn’t show all of them. On the last day of her burial, she was dressed in a normal look, representing her true self who Trisha Echevarria really was.

When I first saw this with my classmates, I thought the movie looked boring, so we decided not to watch it at first. But when I watched it alone, the emotions hit me hard. At first, I was a bit confused because it was already at the ending Trisha had already died—l but I kept watching. I realized that our first “bullies” are really our parents. It’s so painful when your own father or mother does not accept you. Trisha’s father did not accept her, so she left home to follow her dream of becoming a beauty queen. She did everything she could to survive. She and Barbs found ways to work. They became a makeup artist and joined beauty contests because those were their skills. When I saw the part about her being raped, I was shocked. In our country, people are very judgmental. They don’t even consider it rape if the victim didn’t fight back. I also felt bad for Shirley. Being a mother isn’t about gender. There are many women or mothers who neglect their children, but just because someone is a gay or a trans woman doesn’t mean they can’t take care of a child. Some even love and care more than others. The movie Die Beautiful tells the story of Trisha, a trans woman who faces rejection from her family but finds support from people who truly care about her. Her father refuses to accept her identity, while her sister tries to help but is often more loyal to their father than to Trisha. Trisha works hard to follow her dreams and finds love and friendship in her chosen family. The film also shows how rigid family expectations can hurt relationships, like how her father wanted to erase her identity even after her death.

I also realized something—why do some people choose to be cruel? Why do they always hurt others? Just because someone is LGBTQ, it doesn’t affect their life or who they are. That’s why we should choose to be kind to everyone. We should respect and accept people, because sometimes they are the ones with the kindest hearts. The movie balances serious themes like death and abuse with humor and casual dialogue, which makes it easier to watch. It gives a strong representation of the LGBTQIA+ community, especially trans women, showing how Trisha embraces her identity and fights for herself despite doubts. It also highlights relationships with family, friends, and partners and the bonds within the trans community, like the sisterhood and beauty pageant culture. The story shows that acceptance isn’t something you can force. What matters is standing up for yourself, being confident, and living true to who you are.
