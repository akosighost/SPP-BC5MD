I enjoy this movie a lot. It gives clear lessons. Paulo Ballesteros stands out as an actor and as a makeup artist. He brings Trisha Echevarria to life with skill. His talent for copying celebrity faces adds fun to the film. While watching, I kept asking myself why people choose to hurt others.

The story centers on Trisha Echevarria, a trans woman who dreams of joining beauty pageants. Her father refuses to accept her. He is abusive and homophobic. Before becoming Trisha, her name was Patrick. Trisha later adopts a child named Adora after the child’s mother dies. No one wants to look after her. Trisha renames her Shirley Mae Echevarria because she thinks the name Adora sounds unpleasant. Trisha takes care of Shirley. She raises her and sends her to school. Things become difficult for Shirley because her classmates believe Trisha is only a gay parent and not her real mother.

Back in school, Trisha meets a boy named Migs. He plays with her feelings. One day, Barbs and Trisha walk through the hallway. Barbs sees Migs in the parking area and tells Trisha to return his jersey. Trisha approaches him. Migs invites her to eat with his group. After two days, Trisha disappears and Barbs becomes worried. When Barbs finally sees her, Trisha refuses to talk until they reach the restroom. Trisha then tells her that Migs and his friend used her. She agreed at first. After the fourth person, she felt helpless. She does not know if it counts as rape because she agreed at the start.

Trisha goes to the hospital because of an anal injury. Her father arrives and asks what happened. She says it is gastritis because she fears him. The doctor explains the injury came from penetration and trauma. Her father becomes angry when he understands what happened. He slaps her and shouts at her. Beth, Trisha’s sister, stops him. She tells Trisha that what happened was wrong and asks why she did it. Trisha stays quiet. She fears speaking.

Trisha follows her dream of joining beauty contests, but her father refuses to accept it. He disowns her and tells her to stop using his surname. Trisha leaves home. She stays with Barbs. She finds work and continues to join pageants.

Later, she meets Jesse. He treats her with respect. Trisha believes he cares for her and hopes for a future with him. She later learns he has a wife. She still stays with him because she wants to feel loved. After a month, Jesse disappears. One day, Shirley tells Trisha that Jesse’s wife is inside their house. Jesse wants to talk to her. They visit the hospital. Jesse is sick with leukemia. When he wakes up, he explains that his sickness feels like karma. He then tells Trisha the truth. He was involved when Migs and his group abused her. He says the guilt stayed with him. Trisha thinks he approached her out of guilt. Jesse insists that he loves her.

In the final part of the story, Trisha joins a beauty pageant on a TV show. Shirley is now older, has a boyfriend, and is pregnant. Trisha and Shirley argue because Trisha pushes her to join pageants even if she does not want this path. Trisha wins the pageant as Miss Gay Bahamas. During the celebration, she feels dizzy and passes out. Barbs rushes her to the hospital. Trisha dies from an aneurysm.

Before she died, Trisha told Barbs she wanted her first look at her wake to be like Angelina Jolie. Barbs fulfills this. Each night, Trisha has a different look. One is Iza Calzado. Another is Miley Cyrus. Another is a runaway bride. On the last day, they present her in a simple look that shows who she truly was as Trisha Echevarria.
