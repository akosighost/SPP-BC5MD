Die Beautiful is a 2016 Filipino drama-comedy film directed by Jun Robles Lana that highlights a transgender woman, Trisha Echevarria’s, dream of becoming a beauty queen. The story begins with her death right after winning a pageant. The film shows Trisha's best friend, Barbs, fulfilling Trisha's last wish of trying on different make-up looks every night of her wake. The film uses flashbacks to show Trisha's life from a child to an adult, and the struggles and happiness of living as a transgender woman in a society that is not always supportive and accepting.

There is a scene where Trisha wins a barangay beauty pageant wearing a pink dress, but her father angrily drags her away because he cannot accept her identity. Another important part of the film is when Trisha adopts a child named Shirley Mae, who becomes a source of joy and purpose. Trisha and Barbs love Shirley deeply, treating her as their own child, and showing more care and attention than her biological parents. Despite the hardships, the movie also shows happy and funny moments between Trisha and Barbs, and their friendship becomes an example of a chosen family where people support and love each other even when their biological family fails to do so.

The movie talks about important gender issues like identity, acceptance, and beauty standards, using meaningful scenes to show how society judges people by appearance and gender. In one scene, Trisha says, “If I will die and be blessed to live again, I want to still be who I am in this life today. I alone can do the work in this world that I am supposed to do. I alone can fill the space in this world that is in shape of me. I alone have a voice in this world that people will hear and recognize as me. If I am no longer in this world, there are people who will look for me. That is why, if given a chance to live again, I will choose to be nobody, nobody but me,” showing her desire to live freely, authentically and be accepted as the person she truly is. There is also a scene where Trisha is sexually assaulted, which she calls rape because four men were involved and nothing happened by her choice. Many transgender people face exploitation for their money, so true friendship and loyalty become very important.

For me, Die Beautiful is a strong and emotional film because it shows the real challenges faced by transgender women in a way that is easy to understand and very touching, and I appreciate how the movie mixes funny scenes with serious messages to make the story more natural. The acting of Paolo Ballesteros as Trisha is impressive because he shows both strength and vulnerability, and Christian Bables as Barbs gives warmth and loyalty that make their friendship feel real. 

Transgender women face serious discrimination. Trisha’s father rejects her completely and even at her death wants her to return to being male. What makes it even more painful is that this rejection comes from her own blood, her father, and he also does not accept Trisha’s friends. With her sister, you can feel love, but she must stay away and obey their father. However, with Trisha's death, her sister's love prevailed. Watching this film made me think more of consideration, kindness and the most important thing, to stop judging someone for simply being what they want to be. Everybody is entitled to live the way they want and to have the freedom to live their life. I see Die Beautiful, being one of the most, if not the most, highly significant and purposeful, considering the experience most members of the LGBTQ+ community go through and how they are assist to live beautiful lives.
