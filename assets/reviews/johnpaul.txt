Die Beautiful is one of those films that can hurt you and comfort you at the same time. It tells the story of Trisha Echevarria, a transgender woman who spends her whole life trying to be accepted for who she really is. The movie begins with her death, right after she finally wins a beauty pageant crown she has always dreamed of. Instead of seeing her enjoy that moment, we see her best friend Barbs trying to fulfill her last wish, which is giving her a different and beautiful makeup look every night of her wake. This mix of sadness and humor shows what kind of movie it is, something real and honest about life. 

The story goes back to Trisha’s childhood where she tries on makeup secretly, only to be scolded by her father who cannot accept her identity. Those early moments leave a deep hurt that she carries as she grows older. Still, the movie does not make her life look like all pain. It also shows her moments of happiness, especially when she meets Jesse, one of the few people who truly sees her as she is. Their scenes together feel warm and safe, and it makes it even more painful when Jesse is no longer in her life.

There are also moments in the film that show how society treats transgender people unfairly. One of the hardest scenes to watch is when Trisha’s father insists that the hospital list her as male, like her identity can be erased just because someone else says so. It shows how transgender people face struggles even in situations where they should be treated with care and respect.

Even with all the hardships Trisha goes through, the movie also highlights the love she finds in her chosen family. Her relationship with Shirley Mae, the child she raises with Barbs, becomes a very important part of her life. Being a mother gives Trisha joy and purpose, and it shows how naturally she gives love even when she rarely gets it in return.

The strongest part of the movie is the friendship between Trisha and Barbs. Their bond feels real because it is full of jokes, small fights, and moments when they hold each other together. Barbs is the one person who never leaves her, even when things get ugly. There is a scene where Barbs tells Trisha that she does not need a crown to be a queen, and that moment shows how love and understanding can be more powerful than any award or recognition.

The acting of Paolo Ballesteros as Trisha brings so much emotion, while Christian Bables as Barbs gives warmth and loyalty that makes their friendship feel honest.

After watching Die Beautiful, I realized how important acceptance and kindness really are. Some people fight every day just to be themselves, and it means a lot when even one person stands by them. In the end, what stays in my mind is not Trisha’s death but the way she lived her life, with courage, with love, and with the strength to be herself even when the world made it hard.
