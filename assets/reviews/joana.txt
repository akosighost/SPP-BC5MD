The movie 'Die Beautiful' was a wonderful depiction of how transwomen are often treated in the Philippines. Their familoes either accept them or would rather treat them as if they never existed. Trisha, the main character, showed resilience and loved who she is. Her father was transphobic, treating her as if she was a stain in their family's name. Despite her father's hate, Trisha found the love and support she needed through her found family.

The movie also showcased that found family values you more than you would expect with blood relatives. Others might say her sister, Beth, gave her support but her reluctance to defend Trisha and deadnaming her after meeting at a shop isn't a 100% support. Beth was more afraid of their father than losing the connection with Trisha. Beth had also fought with Barbs regarding Trisha's funeral and their father's wish to bring back Trisha's body as 'Patrick' and also implied her disdain to Trisha's transwomen friends, not allowing them to look as themselves while visiting her wake.

It had shown how heavy expectations would drive a gap with familial connection, an example would be how Trisha's father expected her to not be herself, even after Trisha has died her father expected the funeral parlor to de-transition her and make her be 'Patrick' again. Trisha's father stated that he would not have Trisha's casket be opened not looking the way he wants her body to be and saying he wants it as it was before and that it was right. Hearing and watching it, regardless of it being a movie or in real life, was heartbreaking and disrespectful as Trisha's father had shown over and over since childhood to her death that he never accepted Trisha for who she is and what makes her happy.

Suffice to say, 'Die Beautiful' has made me laugh, tear up, and feel pain. The cast's portrayed each character remarkably and had proper representations, it had shown acceptance can be found within yourself and to those that you choose to be around you.
