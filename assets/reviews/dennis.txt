I have watched this Filipino film about Trisha Echevarria, a transgender woman who dreams of being loved, accepted, and seen for who she truly is. The movie  Die Beautiful begins with a twist; Trisha dies right after winning a beauty pageant. Even though she is dead, her story continues through flashbacks shown during her wake. Her best friend Barbs fulfills her last wish, to be make-up each night as famous women, like Beyoncé or Angelina Jolie. These wake scenes connect to memories that reveal Trisha’s entire life. From a storytelling perspective, I'd say the movie is unique. Compared to the pace of other Filipino films. The pacing is slow and I skip a lot of parts, in what I think is a filler, but it's cool in terms of storyboards or direction. Since Trisha is already dead at the beginning, the entire film feels like remembering someone special. 

The film highlights many gender issues in the Philippines. So I tried to refer to her as she/her so it won't be one of the issues.  One example is Trisha’s relationship with her father. In that one scene where he forces Trisha to dress like a boy, yelling at her despite her cry. This shows how family can trauma her and deeply affects transgenders. Another example is when a man she trusts becomes violent towards her when he discovers she is transgender. These scenes show the danger and humiliation that queer people can face. But, the movie also shows joyful moments, like when Trisha joins pageants with her friends cheering loudly behind her. These scenes show that queer life is not all difficult, but also full of love. 

The film also represents transgender identity in a respectful and human way. Trisha is not shown as a joke or stereotype. She is shown as a full person. As a child, she was playful and curious. As a student she makes friends and  as an adult, she becomes a mother to a child she takes in, showing her capacity for love. She also experiences romance, pain, and happiness. The movie teaches that transgender people have real life too and not just defined by their genders.

The wake-makeover scenes carry a social message. Each night, as Barbs transforms Trisha. It symbolizes Trisha’s wish to be seen beautifully. even in death. It also shows how her friends showed her identity until the very end. This stands in contrast to society, which often judged and rejected her. These scenes are both humorous and touching, showing how queer communities also use humor to survive pain.

Our group’s shared critique is that Die Beautiful succeeds in sending a powerful message: everyone deserves to be valued, respected, and accepted. The movie shows the reality of being transgender in the Philippines. The pain, the fear, the dreams, and the beauty. It teaches us that behind makeup or gender identity is a human being who wants to be loved and remembered. Trisha may have died, but through the film, her story continues to inspire others to see queer people as humans, as beautiful.
