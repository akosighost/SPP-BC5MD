Jun Lana's 2016 film, Die Beautiful, is a powerful and touching film that uses a clever structure to tell the story of Trisha Echevarria, a Filipino transgender woman. The movie’s main events happen during her wake, where, according to her final wishes, Trisha’s corpse is dressed as a different celebrity each night. The film uses many flashbacks that start from this unusual funeral setting, allowing the audience to slowly learn about Trisha’s life, which was full of both funny and very difficult moments. This unique approach helps highlight the sharp contrast between her complicated and often chaotic life and the quiet finality of her death. By doing this, the film successfully shows the audience the journey Trisha took, including the discrimination she faced because of her gender identity.

The use of the wake as the central setting is one of the most effective parts of the movie. It is here that Trisha’s friends gather to honor her in the most dramatic way possible—by constantly transforming her appearance. These transformations serve as triggers for the flashbacks, which are the core of the story. The memories take us back through her life, showing her start in beauty pageants and the challenges she overcame to become the person she was. This storytelling technique gives the audience a full, complex picture of a woman who was always performing and fighting to be seen as beautiful and whole. The film makes a clear point that even in death, Trisha’s vibrant spirit and struggle for recognition continued to shape her reality. The narrative is a tribute to the resilient energy needed to live openly in a society that often pressures individuals to conform.

Paolo Ballesteros delivers a truly compelling and complex performance as Trisha. Ballesteros manages to capture the full range of Trisha’s personality, making her feel genuine and relatable. He shows the glamour and success of a celebrated beauty queen who is confident and skilled in her craft. Yet, he also skillfully conveys the deep-seated vulnerabilities that Trisha faced within a society that was often unwilling to accept her. His performance perfectly illustrates the emotional cost of living authentically while constantly facing judgment and discrimination. Ballesteros’s ability to handle both the film’s highest comedic moments and its most serious, emotional ones is central to the movie’s success and is what makes Trisha such a memorable and human character.

The film truly excels at balancing its comedic elements with its serious themes. The revolving fashion show around the coffin, while funny and eccentric, acts as a necessary counterpoint to the difficult reality of Trisha’s life. This lightness is used to ease the weight of the serious topics the film explores, such as the pain of familial rejection and the deep struggle to find one’s identity. By showing the loyal and supportive “chosen family” that Trisha found in her friends, the movie highlights the resilient spirit of the LGBTQ+ community in the Philippines. It emphasizes the importance of friendship and community when biological family support is absent.

While the movie occasionally moves into the territory of comedy drama, it always manages to return to its core emotional truth. Die Beautiful ultimately succeeds as a touching and meaningful commentary on self-acceptance and the simple, desperate human desire to be seen and loved for exactly who one is. It is a heartfelt story that offers important insight into the experiences of transgender people, leaving the audience with a sense of both the joy and the pain that defined Trisha Echevarria’s beautiful, difficult, and unforgettable life.
